# DCOffsetGrN: DC offset adjust (DAC channel setting) in mV. It will automatically recalculated to the correct value of DAC
# -1000: analog input dynamic range = -Vpp to 0 (negative signals)
# +1000: analog input dynamic range = 0 to +Vpp (positive signals)
#     0:   analog input dynamic range = -Vpp/2 to +Vpp/2 (bipolar signals)

# The save option allows you to save certain channels. The digitizer is designed in such that even only one channel is used
# all group must be transfered to PC. Then you can choose by software which channel you want to store and/or display.
# It is one 32 bits word, Each bit correspond to each channel
