[GENERAL SETTINGS]
# Stop acquisition after certain number of seconds, default 0 means acq will runn forever
# Keep in mind that from StopAfterSec, StopAfterFile, StopAfterEvents ONLY ONE CAN BE DIFFERENT THAN 0!
StopAfterSec 0
 
# Stop acquisition after certain number of files, default 0 means acq will run forever, size of the file you have to define in annother variable
StopAfterFile 0
 
# Stop acquisition after certain number of Events, default 0 means acq will runn forever
StopAfterEvents 20000

# Default path where the data is stored, if you do not set this parameter the path will be ./data
DataPath /home/dlab/dg_epool/zaba/data
 
# Default file name, in the GUI version program will ask the user to set correct file name
# The format of file name is: YYYY_MM_DD_hhmm_xxxxxx_nr.bin
# where xxxxxx is the file name and nr file number
# if you put the field of FileName empty then by default the name will be test
# e.g is 2016 July 14, Thursday, 19:56 and you set filename measurement1
#     the file name will be: 2016_07_14_1956_measurement1_000.bin
#     then only the number will be increased, so 001, 002, 003, 004
FileName mes1
 
# Instrument properties: 
# Keep in mind that there are only few parameters which user can change or modified.
# There are much more but for the standard using they are not neccesary to set.
# The parameters below are only these which you can change in the GUI.
# Settings another parameters require adding some code and recompile. The simplest way is to edit DMadc.32.cpp
m_AcqStatusEntry2InitModule either uncomment or write which register and value you wan to set. Similar to what is already there.
# For details of other settings see the documentation.
