This folder contains the vmm3root program. Whereas the vmm2root program was used to analyse the raw data files created by the DATE DAQ, vmm3root reads csv files that have been created by the ESS DAQ (Morten Christensen, Martin Shetty). The python script analyzeData.py analyses all data in a given folder. Test data to check the function of the program can be found in the folder "testdata". To build the program, it is necessary to have root (https://root.cern.ch/)installed. Type "make all" to create the executable. Type "./vmm3root" to learn how to use the program.
